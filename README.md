# Concepts in Object Oriented Programming

## Class

- template for the creation of an object

### `__init__` (initializer)
- Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:

### Attribute (Parameter)
- Descriptions of the object
- Instance attribute (first_name)
- class - level attribute (WSU)

### Methods (Action)
- instance method
    - method that can be performed on the object
- class method
    - allows us to create and modify class level data
- static method
    - does not have access to cls or instancde attributes but performs action within the class
- magic method
    - reserved methods that perform a specific task `__str__`

## Inheritance
- Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class
- Parent Class (Student)
- Child Class (Graduate Student)

    ## Polymorphism
    - methods/functions
